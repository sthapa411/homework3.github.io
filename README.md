Goal:
My goal for this homework was to create a password generator to create secure password for user. The goal was to take users' input by prompting them to choose from uppercase, lowercase, special symbols, and numbers. The criteria was to choose at least one type of character and to have the password length between 8 to 128. The prompts would start after clicking "generate' button. When the criteria was met, the secure password would be generated according to the cirteria provided by the user and displayed in the textarea of the generator. 

Challenges:
The homework was very challenging for me as the concept is very new. Although I have tried my best to fulfill the criteria for homework to my best ability, I am aware that there is a better way of doing it and I might have missed something.
